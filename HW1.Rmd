## Q1 (1 pts)

##### The dataset `quakes` contains information about earthquakes occurring near Fiji since 1964. The first few observations are listed below. 

```{R}
head(quakes)
```

##### How many observations are there of each variable (i.e., how many rows are there; show using code)? How many variables are there total (i.e., how many columns are in the dataset)? You can read more about the dataset [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/quakes.html) *Do not forget to include the code you used to find the answer each question*

```{R}

dim(quakes)
```

There are 1000 rows/observations and 5 variables in the dataset.

---

## Q2 (2 pts)

##### What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for the variables `mag` and `depth`? Note that there are many functions that can be used to answer this question. If you chose to work with each variable separately, recall that you can access individual variables in a dataframe using the `$` operator (e.g., `dataset$variable`). Describe your answer in words.

```{R}
# your code here

min(quakes$mag)
max(quakes$mag)
mean(quakes$mag)
median(quakes$mag)

min(quakes$depth)
max(quakes$depth)
mean(quakes$depth)
median(quakes$depth)
```

Variable "mag": minimum value is 4, maximum value is 6.4, mean is 4.6204, median is 4.6

Variable "depth": minimum value is 40, maximum value is 680, mean is 311.371, median is 247

---

## Q3

##### Recall how logical indexing of a dataframe works in R. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask R for the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175. The two ways produce equivalent results.

```{R}
median(quakes$mag[quakes$long>175])

median(quakes[quakes$long>175,]$mag) #this is the more conventional notation
```

### 3.1 (1 pt) 
##### Explain what each of the two lines of code are doing in words. Specifically, why do we need to use the comma in the second case but not in the first? Remember that the `$` selects a single variable and that `[ ]` are used for indexing whatever object came before (either a single variable or a dataframe).

Both lines of code are finding the median of earthquake magnitudes for anywhere of longitude greater than 175. A comma indicates that you are the subsetting the data by rows versus by columns when there isn't a comma.


### 3.2 (3 pts) 
##### What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's depth and its magnitude?

```{R}
mean(quakes$mag[quakes$depth>(median(quakes$depth))])
mean(quakes$mag[quakes$depth<(median(quakes$depth))])
```

The mean of variable 'mag' when 'depth' is greater than its median and less than its median are 4.5232 and 4.7176, respectively. These values indicate that as depth of the earthquake increases its average magnitude is lower by a fractional amount and vise versa. 

### 3.3 (2 pts) 
##### What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's latitude and it's depth?

```{R}

sd(quakes$lat[quakes$depth>(median(quakes$depth))])
sd(quakes$lat[quakes$depth<(median(quakes$depth))])

```

The standard deviation of variable 'lat' when 'depth' is greater than its median and less than its median are 3.577252 and 6.1501, respectively. These values indicate that as depth of the earthquake increases its variations in the latitude data set is lower than when the depth is lower than the median.

## Q4 (2 pts)

##### The variable `depth` is measured in kilometers. Create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives depth **in meters rather than kilometers** and add it to the dataset `quakes`. To help get you started, I have given you code that creates the new variable but fills it with `NA` values. Overwrite the `NA`s below by writing code on the right-hand side of the assignment operator (`<-`) that computes the requested transformation. Print out the first few rows of the updated dataset using `head()`.

```{R}

quakes$depth_m <- quakes$depth*1000
head(quakes)
```

## Q5

##### Let's make some plots in base R. 

### 5.1 (2 pt) 
##### Create a boxplot of `depth` using the `boxplot()` function. Describe where you see the min, max, and median (which you calculated in question 2) in this plot.

```{R}
boxplot(quakes$depth)
```

In the boxplot the maximum and minimum values are indicated by the horizontal lines above and below the box and the median value is the bold horizontal line inside of the box. 

### 5.2 (2 pt) 
##### Create a histogram of `depth` using the `hist()` function. What important information does the histogram provide that the boxplot does not?

```{R}
hist(quakes$depth, main= "Histogram of Quakes Depth", xlab="Depth")
```

The histogram provides a imagery of the distribution of the dataset, something the boxplot cannot show. 

### 5.3 (2 pt) 
##### Create a scatterplot by plotting variables `mag` and `stations` against each other using the `plot()` function. Note that to generate a scatterplot, the `plot()` takes two arguments: the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. Describe the relationship between the two variables.

```{R}
plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations, main = "Quakes Relationship between Magnitude and Stations",
     xlab = "Magnitude", ylab = "Stations",
     pch = 19, frame = FALSE)


```

There is a positive linear relationship between stations and the magnitude of the earthquake. 

### 5.4 (3 pt) 
##### Create scatterplot of the quakes' geographic locations by plotting `long` on the x-axis and `lat` on the y-axis. Using this plot, and the map/link below (note the two trenches), and some of the techniques you practiced above, are deeper quakes more likely to originate east or west of Fiji?

[Link to location on Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.1679389,175.7587479,3513560m/data=!3m1!1e3)

```{R fig.width=4, fig.height=4}

plot(quakes$long, quakes$lat, main = "Quakes Relationship Longitude vs Latitude",
     xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude",
     pch = 19, frame = FALSE)

mean(quakes$depth[quakes$long>178])
mean(quakes$depth[quakes$long<178])

```

According to the data, deeper quakes are more likely to be on the East of Fiji and shallower quakes on the West.
